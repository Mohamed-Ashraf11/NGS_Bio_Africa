## Next Generation Sequencing Bioinformatics Africa

### This repo serves as a base for course materials and code used for the course
Welcome to the WGC WCS/H3ABioNet NGS_2022 course!

Next generation sequencing (NGS) has become an essential tool in genetic and genomic analysis. It is increasingly important for experimental scientists to gain the bioinformatics skills required to analyse the large volumes of data produced by next generation sequencers. This course will equip participants with the essential informatics skills required to begin analysing NGS data and apply some of the most commonly used tools and resources for sequence data analysis.

The programme will cover prominent sequencing technologies, algorithmic theory and principles of bioinformatics, with a strong focus on practical computational sessions using sequence analysis techniques and tools applicable to any species or genome size. A variety of applications will be covered from post-sequencing analysis - QC, alignment, assembly, variant calling and RNA-Seq.

#### Requirements for course
* The course virtual machine
* Access to the Vula platform for video lectures and assignment submission portal
* Attending the contact sessions twice a week (via zoom) for questions and practicals

#### Requirements for certification
* Attend 80% of all contact sessions (in cases where it is impossible to do so you must inform the TAs for your classroom).
* Submit 80% of practical assignments by the relevant hand-in dates.
* Submit assessments by the relevant hand-in dates and obtain a minimum grade of 60% overall for the assessments (one assessment per Module).



### Dates running
This course runs between 22 March - 9 June 2022
